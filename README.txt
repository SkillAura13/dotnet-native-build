C# Native Build Helper by Chase L

These scripts are licensed under a very permissive license as they are stuff you could easily do yourself if you weren't busy pasting from Rohitab.

They only work on .NET CORE applications. Make sure dotnet is added to path.

Just run Setup.bat and it will generate build scripts for you.

If you somehow manage to fuck this up I don't know how you breathe on your own.
